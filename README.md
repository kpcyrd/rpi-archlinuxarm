rpi-archlinuxarm
================

base docker image of archlinux arm


essentially the same as [`base/archlinux`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/base/archlinux/) (minimal installation) for raspberry pi (ARM)

with the added bonus of:

- updates
- bash
- `pacman.conf`
  - `Color`
  - `ILoveCandy` enabled by default
